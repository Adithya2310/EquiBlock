```

### 2. **Real-Time Price Oracle**
EquiBlock integrates **Pyth Network oracles** to provide accurate, real-time price feeds for underlying assets like the Nikkei index. This ensures that EquiAssets accurately mirror their real-world counterparts.

### 3. **Liquidation Protection**
The **Vincent** system continuously monitors collateral ratios across all positions. If a position falls below the safe threshold, automated liquidation mechanisms are triggered to maintain system health and protect all users from cascading failures.

### 4. **Trading**
Once minted, EquiAssets can be traded freely on the platform, providing users with exposure to global markets without the need for traditional financial intermediaries.
