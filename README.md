# EquiBlock üåç

> Trade global stocks without the hassle

Ever wanted to invest in Japanese stocks or other international markets but got stopped by complicated paperwork, high fees, or geographic restrictions? EquiBlock makes it simple.

We let you create and trade **EquiAssets** ‚Äî digital tokens that follow the prices of real-world stocks like the Nikkei index. Think of them as digital twins of actual stocks that you can buy and sell 24/7, right from your crypto wallet. No banks, no brokers, no borders.

## üöÄ What Makes EquiBlock Special?

- **Create Digital Stock Tokens**: Turn your crypto into tokens that track real stock prices
- **Your Money is Safe**: Every token is backed by 5x its value in PYUSD (a stable dollar-pegged coin), so you're protected even if prices swing wildly
- **Always Up-to-Date**: We use Pyth oracles ‚Äî think of them as super reliable price reporters that constantly check stock prices
- **Trade Directly with Others**: No middlemen taking cuts or controlling your trades
- **Access from Anywhere**: Whether you're in Tokyo, New York, or anywhere else, you can trade
- **Smart Protection System**: Our Vincent system watches over everything to make sure the platform stays healthy and your investments are safe
- **Save on Fees**: Forget about expensive broker commissions

## üèóÔ∏è How Does It Work?

### 1. **Creating Your EquiAssets**
Think of it like putting down a deposit. You put in PYUSD (a stablecoin), and we create tokens that follow stock prices. We ask for 5x the value as collateral ‚Äî so if you want $100 worth of Nikkei tokens, you deposit $500. This keeps everything super safe.

```
Put in PYUSD ‚Üí Get EquiAssets ‚Üí Trade them anytime
```

### 2. **Getting Real Prices**
We use something called Pyth Network ‚Äî it's like having thousands of reliable sources constantly checking stock prices and agreeing on the correct number. This means your EquiAssets always reflect the real market price.

### 3. **Staying Safe**
Our Vincent system is like a watchful guardian. It constantly checks everyone's accounts to make sure they have enough collateral. If someone's account gets too risky, the system automatically fixes it before it can cause problems for anyone else.

### 4. **Trading**
Once you have EquiAssets, you can trade them with other users anytime you want. It's like having a global stock exchange that never closes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Things to Know

EquiBlock is an experimental platform that lets you get exposure to stock prices through crypto. Here's what you should understand:

- **Not the Real Thing**: EquiAssets track stock prices, but they're not actual stocks. You don't own shares in the companies
- **It's Risky**: Like all crypto and DeFi, there are risks. Only invest what you can afford to lose
- **Do Your Homework**: Research and understand how everything works before jumping in
- **Check Your Local Laws**: Make sure using platforms like this is okay where you live
- **Prices Move**: Just like real stocks, the value of EquiAssets goes up and down

Think of EquiAssets as digital mirrors of stock prices, not the actual stocks themselves.
